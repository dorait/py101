This repo is work in progress. i am constantly tweaking existing examples, adding new ones and adding practice problems. With each workshop I conduct, I gain a few insights about Python, Teaching Python and the Learner's difficulties.

This is not meant to be a self study resource. I started out simply saving the examples I used to code in front of my class and put them all in one place. There is still a lot of work to be done.
